Hello!

You're about to enter the wild world of data analysis.

To start with you'll need a copy of Python 3.7.4 installed on your computer.
Make sure to 'install to PATH'!

https://www.python.org/

second. you should double click to run 'requirements-install.bat' which will use pip installer to install pandas which is a useful data library for python.

third. it's time to read 'How to Generate the JSON file.txt' to gather information from your codebase.

fourth. open CSV_Generator.py using your desired code editor (or even notepad.exe) and change the variables at the bottom to gather what information you desire.

fifth. and here's the tricky part. Perform data analysis using the .csv files created. (or even use the JSON file directly)

sixth. Use your new found knowledge for good/evil/balance/powergaming/fun/to win an argument/to laugh/to cry/to make a PR and balance whatever injustice you see in the data. The world is your oyster!

Best of luck
