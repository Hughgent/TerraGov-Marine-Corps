Hello!

I see that you are looking to learn a bit about this codebase.

This takes advantage of the hard work of strongDMM.
https://github.com/SpaiR/StrongDMM

we are using the sdmmparser.exe to create this json file that we will use with the python script to generate useful csv dumps of things in this codebase.

The python script has it's own instructions built into comments in the code. It requires a JSON file to function. So let's generate that!

sdmmparser.exe has no user interface. we need to use the commandline. 
It takes two arguments:
a file path to the codebases .dme
a file path to the output json file.

depending on your computer knowledge and or administrative access to your system there are a number of ways of accomplishing this.

The method I am including in this is as follows.

1. hold shift and right click in the "\tools\Balance Tool" folder.
2. select "Open Powershell window here"
3. copy and then paste in the following. (changing the filepath to tgmc.dme as needed.)

.\sdmmparser.exe D:\Documents\GitHub\TerraGov-Marine-Corps\tgmc.dme .\peanuts.json

4. press enter.

With that, it should take a moment or two and generate a peanuts.json file in the Balance Tool folder.

Now it's time to carry on to BalanceCheck.py
